# MicroDuck ROM simulator release and operations

The ROM simulator runs only verified, qualified policy bundles. Qualification and
serving use the same code-owned action specifications and child-owned
`MicroduckMujocoRuntime`; the CLI/API parent never owns MuJoCo or ONNX objects,
and there is no manifest-selected Python evaluator.

## 1. Export and build a candidate

Export with the repository exporter so the observation normalizer and exact
source, task, checkpoint, and run identities are embedded in ONNX metadata:

```bash
COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
uv run scripts/export.py Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck \
  --wandb-run-path entity/project/run-id \
  --checkpoint 3000

uv run scripts/build_rom_bundle.py \
  --release 1.0.0-candidate.1 \
  --artifact WALK_VELOCITY=output.onnx \
  --output ../release/microduck-development-candidate.zip \
  --model src/mjlab_microduck/robot/microduck/scene_walk.xml \
  --terrain flat \
  --scenario-profile SEEDED_SERVO_RESET_V1 \
  --source-commit "$COMMIT" \
  --checkpoint model_3000.pt \
  --experiment-ref entity/project/run-id \
  --created-at 2026-08-29T12:00:00+00:00 \
  --software-license-id Apache-2.0 \
  --software-license-file LICENSE \
  --model-license-id LicenseRef-MicroDuck-CC-BY-SA-NC \
  --model-license-status DEVELOPMENT_ONLY \
  --model-license-file README.md
```

Never hand-convert a checkpoint. Candidate and promoted outputs must live
outside `src/mjlab_microduck/robot/microduck`; the qualification CLI resolves
and protects that repository robot-source root in addition to the candidate
bundle root. Additional protected roots can be repeated with
`--protected-source-root`.

This production-model example is intentionally `DEVELOPMENT_ONLY`. The
repository's `README.md` is the checked-in evidence for its stated Creative
Commons BY-SA-NC terms; the local `LicenseRef` avoids inventing an SPDX version
that declaration does not state. Building or qualifying this bundle does not
clear it for distribution, and the distribution handoff command will reject
it. Cleared handoff verification uses only the separate minimal Apache-2.0 test
MJCF fixture, never `scene_walk.xml` or its model closure.

Extract the candidate into a new staging directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ../release/candidate
python -m zipfile -e ../release/microduck-development-candidate.zip \
  ../release/candidate
```

## 2. Declare and run qualification

Mandatory versus optional is release policy, not an implication of the action
catalog. Every candidate action currently marked `AVAILABLE` must appear in the
release configuration. A mandatory action must already have verified policy,
model, scenario, and runtime support. Optional actions without that support stay
`UNAVAILABLE` with their original reason; they are not falsely qualified.
The builder and promoted bundle always retain the complete ordered 15-action V1
catalog. Actions already marked `UNAVAILABLE` may be omitted from `release.json`;
qualification carries each one deterministically as `UNAVAILABLE` using its
code-owned reason. Any action a release intends to qualify, and every action the
candidate marks `AVAILABLE`, still requires an explicit governed declaration.

Example `release.json` for the currently supported flat walking runtime:

```json
{
  "schema": "MICRODUCK_ROM_RELEASE_V1",
  "release": "1.0.0",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-29T12:00:00Z",
  "actions": [
    {
      "actionCode": "WALK_VELOCITY",
      "mandatory": true,
      "terrain": "flat",
      "resetProfile": "DEFAULT_STANDING",
      "seeds": [7, 11, 29],
      "maxSteps": 500,
      "parameters": {"vxMps": 0.1, "vyMps": 0.0, "yawRateRadps": 0.0},
      "thresholds": {
        "minSuccessRate": 1.0,
        "maxFallRate": 0.0,
        "maxMeanTrackingError": 0.25,
        "minMeanDistanceM": 0.5,
        "maxMeanEnergyProxy": 200.0,
        "maxActuatorClampSteps": 0,
        "maxPhysicalJointLimitViolations": 0,
        "actionMetric": "trackingError",
        "actionMetricOperator": "lte",
        "actionMetricThreshold": 0.25
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run the bounded batteries and promote to a new immutable version/output:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run scripts/qualify_rom_bundle.py \
  --bundle-dir ../release/candidate \
  --release-config ../release/release.json \
  --output ../release/microduck-development-qualified-1.0.0.zip
```

The output path must not exist. Promotion never changes the candidate directory
or ZIP. An optional threshold failure remains in the catalog as
`UNAVAILABLE / QUALIFICATION_FAILED`; a mandatory failure produces no promoted
ZIP.

Release files cannot select a runtime revision. Qualification derives it from
the installed `mjlab-microduck` package version and a digest of the exact
governed runtime modules. Batteries require 3–16 unique seeds and 100–2,000
steps, and action commands, terrain, reset, action metric, and metric direction
must match the code-owned action specification.

Each seed executes through the production supervisor and runtime child over
canonical `SOCK_SEQPACKET` messages. The child loads the verified candidate and
runs the native runtime with real-time pacing disabled for up to `maxSteps`:
continuous success reaches exactly that horizon, while discrete success or
failure may terminate earlier. Every exact child PID is reaped before promotion
continues, and the qualification parent does not import the native runtime.

The auditable runtime-revision source set includes both executed package
initializers and every governed module under `mjlab_microduck.rom`: action
catalog/specs, API, bundle/contracts, composition and secret-file loading,
model semantics, native runtime/policy/observation, qualification, process
protocol/service/supervisor, runtime child and parent-death handling, runtime
identity, service/store, and the supervisor state machine. Tests require that
changing any one of these files changes the revision.

Every runtime child crosses the image's `/usr/bin/setpriv --pdeathsig SIGTERM`
boundary before Python starts. The supervisor PID captured before launch is a
strict positional argument: a minimal `-P` bootstrap checks `getppid()` before
importing the runtime module, and the child checks the same identity again when
it installs its catchable SIGTERM contract. This closes both the exec/import
orphan window and parent replacement ambiguity without Python `preexec_fn`
(which is unsafe in the multithreaded API daemon). `setpriv` is supplied by the
base image's Debian `util-linux` package and remains covered by the base-image
package/license inventory. SIGTERM deliberately preserves the child-local
zero-stop opportunity; EOF plus the supervisor's exact-PID TERM/KILL/reap
barrier remain the other containment layers.

The qualification report contains bounded per-seed success, fall, stepwise
tracking statistics, distance, normalized-action energy proxy, separately
counted actuator-clamp steps and physical joint-limit violations, max-action, and
action-specific metrics, with timestamps and exact simulator, runtime, model,
policy, source, checkpoint, and run identities. Its
`subjectBundleDigest` is the digest of the verified candidate bytes actually
executed. The promoted manifest and promoted digest then cover that report as an
artifact. This `VERIFIED_INPUT_BUNDLE_DIGEST_V1` rule avoids an impossible
self-referential digest: the report never claims to contain the final ZIP digest.

Raw rollout domains are code-owned. `rollRotationRad`, `slopeProgressM`, and
`yawRotationRad` are signed. `payloadLifted`, `standFraction`,
`supportFootContact`, `terrainExitReached`, and `uprightReached` are fractions
in `[0, 1]`. Every other declared action metric is nonnegative. Tracking error,
its sum and maximum, distance, energy, and maximum absolute action are also
nonnegative and finite. Each rollout carries one tracking sample per completed
control step plus the accumulated sum. The runtime serializes the sum to six
decimal places and defines the canonical tracking mean as that serialized sum
divided by a positive sample count, rounded to six decimal places. Startup
recomputes this value rather than trusting a terminal snapshot; zero or invalid
sample counts fail qualification.

Action-metric values are never an independent authority. Startup derives
`trackingError` from the verified tracking sum/sample mean, `baseTravelM` from
`distanceM`, `standFraction` from `uprightSteps / steps`, `yawRotationRad` from
its explicit yaw accumulator, and `standPoseError` from the final STAND pose
field. The carried `actionMetricValue` must equal that code-owned derivation
exactly, and aggregates, thresholds, and promotion status use the derived
value. The carried `trackingError` duplicate must likewise equal the canonical
sum/sample mean exactly; no trust-boundary tolerance may cross a threshold. A
metric key without an installed derivation fails closed.

Governed STAND completion requires ten consecutive samples that each satisfy
the same shared runtime limits: pose error at most 0.08 rad, trunk height in
`[0.09, 0.14]` m, trunk tilt at most 15 degrees, and maximum absolute joint
speed at most 0.5 rad/s. Raw evidence records the final consecutive count plus
the maximum pose error, minimum/maximum trunk height, maximum tilt, and maximum
joint speed over exactly that claimed window. Qualification checks those
extrema against the shared limits and against the rollout tracking maximum;
ten high-error samples cannot be relabeled as settled. Runtime task evidence
remains bounded to 32 scalar fields and 1 KiB.

## 3. Build and run the container

The commands below run the qualified `DEVELOPMENT_ONLY` production-model bundle
for local validation. They do not create a distribution handoff or change its
license status.

```bash
docker build -f docker/rom-simulator/Dockerfile \
  -t microduck-rom-sim:1.0.0 .

mkdir -p ../release/qualified-bundle
python -m zipfile -e ../release/microduck-development-qualified-1.0.0.zip \
  ../release/qualified-bundle

# The image runs as numeric UID/GID 10001. Create the only durable writable
# host directory and the protected secret directory explicitly; do not rely
# on Docker creating either one as root.
sudo install -d -o 10001 -g 10001 -m 0750 ../release/state
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 ../release/state
sudo chmod 0750 ../release/state
sudo install -d -o 10001 -g 10001 -m 0700 ../release/secrets
openssl rand -base64 48 | sudo install -o 10001 -g 10001 -m 0400 /dev/stdin \
  ../release/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token

docker run --name microduck-rom-sim --rm \
  --detach \
  --user 10001:10001 \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=64m \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath ../release/qualified-bundle)",dst=/bundle,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath ../release/state)",dst=/state \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath ../release/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token)",dst=/run/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token,readonly \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  --stop-timeout 60 \
  microduck-rom-sim:1.0.0
```

Linux is the supported production target. The image and launch both select
UID/GID 10001, the root filesystem is read-only, all capabilities are dropped,
and privilege escalation is disabled. `/bundle` is an explicit read-only
mount; `/state` is the only persistent writable mount and must remain owned by
10001:10001 with mode 0700 or 0750; `/tmp` is a bounded, `noexec`, `nosuid`
ephemeral workspace for verified MJCF snapshots. A valid qualified mount
activates the process-isolated runtime during startup. Invalid bundle, token,
state, model, or policy inputs fail closed.

The bearer file must be a regular, non-symlink file owned by UID/GID 10001,
with mode 0400, mounted read-only at the exact path shown above. The image sets
only that non-secret path; the bearer value is never placed in image or
container environment metadata, command arguments, or image history. Keep
shell tracing disabled while handling credentials.

The image declares `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`, and the shell entrypoint uses `exec`,
so the Python API parent is PID 1. A stop reaches its lifespan shutdown, which
stops or contains the active task, forwards only to its exact owned child,
waits for exact reap, and exits nonzero if that containment barrier fails. The
60-second Docker stop timeout is deliberately above the bounded runtime
operation, termination, kill, and reap envelope; Docker's final `SIGKILL` is a
last resort rather than the normal child cleanup path.

After `Popen.wait()` confirms the exact owned child was reaped and while PID 1
is still executing its shutdown path, the parent atomically writes and fsyncs
`/state/tasks.sqlite3.shutdown-v1.json`. The bounded record identifies the
namespace child PID, final API exit code, and the ordered `CHILD_REAPED` then
`PID1_EXITING` events. It is replaced at the next shutdown and removed at the
next startup; operators can use it to distinguish a proved PID-1 reap from
Docker's eventual cgroup cleanup.

The build syncs only the exact-pinned `rom` dependency group from the frozen
lockfile. The ROM runtime does not import BAM, Torch, CUDA, or `mjlab`; it
executes the verified deployment bundle with the governed position-actuator
semantics. This keeps Git and training-only integration code out of the runtime
image without floating any installed dependency version.

The Dockerfile-specific ignore file and root-context `.dockerignore` are
deny-by-default literal allowlists. They admit only the lock/package/license
metadata, each named ROM Python module, the three authoritative schema/OpenAPI
fixture files, and the entrypoint. There is no Python wildcard or directory
copy, so a newly added debug or secret module remains outside the context and
image until explicitly reviewed. Robot, training, tests, checkpoints, outputs,
env files, logs, caches, handoff work, STL, and `.part` paths remain excluded.
The final image carries `/app/LICENSE`, `/app/pyproject.toml`, and the exact
schemas under `/app/schemas`; it contains no production or
distribution-restricted model bytes. Runtime model resolution is exclusively
from the verified `/bundle` mount.

## 4. Authenticated API checks

Keep tokens out of source control, command arguments, environment variables,
screenshots, transcripts, and shell tracing. This helper reads the protected
file into an unexported subshell variable and streams a curl configuration over
standard input, so neither the bearer nor the authorization header enters curl
arguments:

```bash
ROM_SECRET_FILE=../release/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token
rom_curl() {
  sudo cat "$ROM_SECRET_FILE" | {
    IFS= read -r bearer
    printf 'header = "Authorization: Bearer %s"\n' "$bearer"
  } | curl --config - "$@"
}
```

Liveness is public; all other endpoints require the exact bearer token:

```bash
curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/health
rom_curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ready
rom_curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/catalog
```

Read the installed identities from the catalog before creating a task:

```bash
CATALOG=$(rom_curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/catalog)
BUNDLE_VERSION=$(printf '%s' "$CATALOG" | jq -r .bundleVersion)
BUNDLE_DIGEST=$(printf '%s' "$CATALOG" | jq -r .bundleDigest)
```

Every body sent with `POST` or `PUT` below `/v1` is limited to 65,536 bytes
before route or path-parameter validation. The limit is enforced while ASGI
chunks arrive even when `Content-Length` is absent; an oversized body receives
HTTP 413 with `REQUEST_BODY_TOO_LARGE`. Contract strings,
collections, parameter maps, scenarios, event payloads, and persisted canonical
requests have smaller schema bounds. V1 accepts only the exact seeded scenario
object `{"terrain":"flat"|"ramp","seed":<uint32>}` and rejects extra fields
or JSON type coercion.

Standard JSON Schema keywords encode types, ranges, collection counts, string
bounds, and raw-control property-name rejection where portable keywords exist.
Canonical UTF-8 byte limits, maximum nesting depth, finite/strict scalar rules,
and case-insensitive semantic checks are declared as `x-unergy-invariants` and
must also be enforced by a semantic validator; standard JSON Schema alone does
not implement those checks. Shared Python/ROM accept-and-reject examples live in
`schemas/microduck-v1-portability-fixtures.json`.

Create a short continuous task, renew it once, then cancel it:

```bash
TASK=11111111111111111111111111111111
rom_curl --fail --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks \
  -d "{\"schema\":\"MICRODUCK_SIM_TASK_V1\",\"taskId\":\"$TASK\",\"actionCode\":\"WALK_VELOCITY\",\"bundleVersion\":\"$BUNDLE_VERSION\",\"bundleDigest\":\"$BUNDLE_DIGEST\",\"parameters\":{\"vxMps\":0.0,\"vyMps\":0.0,\"yawRateRadps\":0.0},\"scenario\":{\"terrain\":\"flat\",\"seed\":7},\"leaseMs\":500,\"requestedBy\":\"operator-smoke\"}"

rom_curl --fail --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks/$TASK/command" \
  -d '{"commandSequence":1,"parameters":{"vxMps":0.0,"vyMps":0.0,"yawRateRadps":0.0},"leaseMs":500}'

rom_curl --fail --silent -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks/$TASK/cancel"
```

Task events are returned in bounded pages. `afterSequence` defaults to `-1` so
the first request includes lifecycle sequence `0`; `pageSize` defaults to 100
and must be from 1 through 100. The cursor range is `-1` through the signed
64-bit maximum (`9223372036854775807`). Continue with the last returned sequence
until the `events` array is empty. The exclusive cursor prevents duplicates:

```bash
rom_curl --fail --silent \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks/$TASK/events?afterSequence=-1&pageSize=100"
```

One fail-closed readiness predicate governs executable catalog availability,
new task creation, and continuous command renewal. If the watchdog fails,
`/v1/ready` reports `ready:false` with `WATCHDOG_UNHEALTHY`, installed catalog
entries are masked unavailable, and create/command return HTTP 503 `NOT_READY`.
An active continuous owner is immediately zeroed/stopped and durably becomes
`FAILED / WATCHDOG_FAILURE`. Authenticated cancellation and diagnostic task,
status, and event reads remain available. Catalog and robot status also
document HTTP 503 `NOT_READY` for startup states in which their required
installed bundle or runtime is absent.

The API parent owns durable task state and SQLite; it owns no runtime handle,
policy thread, MuJoCo model, or ONNX session. One supervisor owner thread
controls one exact `Popen` child and a bounded canonical `SOCK_SEQPACKET` queue.
The child alone loads the verified bundle, owns native runtime state, arms the
local lease deadman before acknowledging `START`, and performs zero-and-stop on
lease expiry, parent EOF, or shutdown. Diagnostic reads use cached bounded
status, so GET/status/events and cancellation remain responsive during a native
stall.

An operation timeout, malformed packet, fatal runtime result, or child exit
quarantines that exact generation and fails readiness closed. The task is
durably terminalized truthfully, but the motion slot is not released until the
child acknowledges completed cleanup or the supervisor sends `SIGTERM`,
escalates to `SIGKILL` if necessary, and reaps the exact stored process. No
process-name lookup or pattern kill is used. A child that exits after a
`START` acknowledgement without a terminal event is detected autonomously,
reaped, and durably failed; a queued valid terminal event is consumed before
that exit is classified.

After exact reap, the supervisor may spawn and verify a fresh child for a new
generation; `RUNTIME_UNRESPONSIVE` does not by itself require restarting the
whole API/container. Catalog motion stays masked and creates fail closed until
the replacement handshake is ready. A full parent/container restart is the
recovery boundary only when the API parent itself terminates or cannot complete
its bounded shutdown; persisted nonterminal tasks then reconcile to `UNKNOWN`.

To smoke the deadman, create a distinct continuous task with `"leaseMs":200`,
send no renewal, wait more than 200 ms, and query it:

```bash
DEADMAN_TASK=22222222222222222222222222222222
rom_curl --fail --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks \
  -d "{\"schema\":\"MICRODUCK_SIM_TASK_V1\",\"taskId\":\"$DEADMAN_TASK\",\"actionCode\":\"WALK_VELOCITY\",\"bundleVersion\":\"$BUNDLE_VERSION\",\"bundleDigest\":\"$BUNDLE_DIGEST\",\"parameters\":{\"vxMps\":0.0,\"vyMps\":0.0,\"yawRateRadps\":0.0},\"scenario\":{\"terrain\":\"flat\",\"seed\":11},\"leaseMs\":200,\"requestedBy\":\"operator-deadman-smoke\"}"

sleep 0.4
rom_curl --fail --silent \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/tasks/$DEADMAN_TASK"
```

The durable terminal state must be `TIMED_OUT`; continuous renewal cessation
never means success.

Discrete smoke is catalog-driven. `STAND` has exact SitStand-family runtime
semantics: `TRAINED_SITTING` reset, fixed `SIT_FLAG_ZERO` posture goal, fall
handling, and sustained `STAND_POSE_SETTLED` completion. It is `AVAILABLE` only
when the mounted bundle includes the matching SitStand ONNX/model and a passing
governed STAND result. The deterministic nonrestricted handoff fixture
demonstrates an authenticated `STAND` request progressing
`ACCEPTED` → `RUNNING` → `SUCCEEDED`; it does not claim a production robot
checkpoint. Other discrete actions such as `SPIN` remain unavailable until
their own exact artifacts and semantics pass qualification, and return the
stable `ACTION_UNAVAILABLE` error.

## 5. Persistence, restart, and backup

The SQLite database and related state live under `/state`. For the simplest
consistent backup, stop the container, archive the whole host state directory,
then restart with the same mounts and secret file:

```bash
docker stop microduck-rom-sim
tar -C ../release -czf "state-backup-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).tgz" state
```

Rotate the bearer by atomically reserving a unique filename, stopping and
replacing the container with the same hardening flags and a read-only mount of
that new file, then removing only the previously active file after the
replacement is ready. Reusing a fixed `.next` name can overwrite the inode
still mounted by an active container on a later rotation. Docker cannot replace
a bind-mounted file safely inside an existing container:

```bash
: "${ROM_SECRET_FILE:=../release/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token}"
ROM_SECRET_PREVIOUS=$ROM_SECRET_FILE
ROM_SECRET_FILE=$(sudo mktemp -p ../release/secrets \
  microduck_rom_bearer_token.XXXXXXXX)
openssl rand -base64 48 | sudo tee "$ROM_SECRET_FILE" >/dev/null
sudo chown 10001:10001 "$ROM_SECRET_FILE"
sudo chmod 0400 "$ROM_SECRET_FILE"
docker stop microduck-rom-sim
docker run --name microduck-rom-sim --rm \
  --detach \
  --user 10001:10001 \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=64m \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath ../release/qualified-bundle)",dst=/bundle,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath ../release/state)",dst=/state \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(realpath "$ROM_SECRET_FILE")",dst=/run/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token,readonly \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  --stop-timeout 60 \
  microduck-rom-sim:1.0.0
rom_curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ready || {
  echo "replacement is not ready; previous secret retained" >&2
  exit 1
}
sudo rm -- "$ROM_SECRET_PREVIOUS"
unset ROM_SECRET_PREVIOUS
```

After final shutdown, explicitly remove the active credential and its now-empty
directory:

```bash
docker stop microduck-rom-sim
sudo rm -- "$ROM_SECRET_FILE"
sudo rmdir ../release/secrets
```

On process restart, tasks that were in a nonterminal state are reconciled to
`UNKNOWN`; the simulator never assumes physical/simulation motion continued
across process death. Clients must inspect the task and create a new intent.

## 6. License boundary and troubleshooting

The Python code and container packaging are Apache-2.0; the image includes the
repository `LICENSE`. Repository 3D model
files are CC BY-SA-NC and are deliberately excluded from the image. A bundle
mount is a separately reviewed distribution unit: include only assets and
attributions whose redistribution is authorized for the target use. The
deterministic handoff fixture uses a minimal test MJCF, embeds a declared
Apache-2.0 license artifact, and contains no production STL or `.part` file.

Stable operator signals:

| Signal | Meaning / action |
|---|---|
| `BEARER_TOKEN_MISSING` | Mount a nonempty owner-only bearer file at `/run/secrets/microduck_rom_bearer_token`. |
| `BUNDLE_UNAVAILABLE` | Mount an extracted promoted bundle at `/bundle`; verify manifest and artifact bytes. |
| `QUALIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE` | Candidate, missing, forged, duplicate, mismatched, or partial qualification data was rejected; mount the exact promoted output. |
| `STATE_DB_UNAVAILABLE` | Make `/state` writable by UID/GID 10001 and verify free space. |
| `RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE` | Bundle verification passed but model/policy/runtime preflight failed; rebuild from exact governed artifacts. |
| `RUNTIME_UNRESPONSIVE` | A runtime call exceeded its monotonic deadline; the supervisor quarantines, terminates, and exactly reaps that child before a fresh generation can become ready. Investigate repeated failures; do not bypass readiness. |
| `WATCHDOG_UNHEALTHY` | Restart and investigate host scheduling/resource pressure before accepting motion. |
| `ACTION_UNAVAILABLE` | Inspect the catalog reason; do not bypass qualification or runtime support. |
| `BUNDLE_MISMATCH` | Refresh catalog identities and recreate the request against the installed release. |
| `TIMED_OUT` | Lease renewal ceased; this is the expected safe stop, not success. |
| restart `UNKNOWN` | Reconcile client intent; never resume an old task implicitly. |

CLI errors are intentionally concise and omit paths, model contents, and
tracebacks. Preserve the candidate, release configuration, promoted digest, and
sanitized API transcript for audit; never preserve the bearer value.
